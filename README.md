üöå Route Optimization System using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
A modular Python-based system for real-time bus route optimization in Delhi, using a custom Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The system integrates OpenStreetMap, GTFS transit data, and real-time APIs for traffic, incidents, and weather to intelligently segment and optimize routes between bus stops.
üöÄ Features

1. Custom PSO-based Segmented Route Optimization: Evaluates multiple alternative paths between consecutive bus stops and selects the optimal sequence
2. Multi-factor Fitness Function: Incorporates:
    a. Road segment length
    b. Real-time traffic speeds and congestion
    c. Weather impacts (e.g. rain, wind, temperature)
    d. Traffic incidents and road closures


3. Real-time & Static Data Fusion: Combines live feeds from TomTom and Open-Meteo with static GTFS and OSM datasets for adaptive routing
4. Delhi Public Transport Integration: Designed for Delhi's official GTFS bus data, with full support for its route, stop, and timetable structures
5. Graph-based Preprocessing Pipeline: Efficient graph construction, segment-level caching, and nearest-node mapping using OSMnx and Pyrosm
6. Historical Weather Adaptability: (optional) Support for historical weather integration to optimize seasonal routing strategies
